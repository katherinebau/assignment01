	<h1>Camp Kesem</h1>

<div>
	<p>This summer, I spent my last week at Camp Kesem. Camp Kesem is a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. Its a haven for them to go where others understand how they feel and the positions that they are in. At Camp Kesem, I met the sunniest, more inspiring, more resilient campers. All with big hearts even in the face of difficult times. All still willing to comfort others and to feel their pain. I learned more than I thought I ever could from those campers. </p>

<b>Things I learned at Camp Kesem</b>
<ul>
	<li>Gaga ball is super intense</li>
	<li>Friendship bracelets are a favorite for tween girls and myself</li>
	<li>Everyone has the capacity to throw kindness up in the air</li>
	<li>It's hard to be an ugly crier at this camp - but it's also more than okay</li>
	<li>Scrapes are okay if there/s a friend with you</li>

</ul>
